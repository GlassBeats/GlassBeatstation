You can use a variety of programs to route audio/midi to your liking. I recommend catia from the kxstudio repos for it's simplicity and patchbay style, but I believe qjackctl is quite commonly used as well

also big thanks to the project https://github.com/FMMT666/launchpad.py - for determining the errors in the launchpad documentation!
